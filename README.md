# AI Based Student Monitoring System<br />

### Introduction:<br />

To suggest and evaluate the effective teaching methodologies, educational institutions should
regularly perform tracking of dozens of indicators related to the academic performance of their
students. Considering the complex nature of modern education, it’s barely possible to complete
such a task manually. Fortunately, assessment apps allow educational institutions to monitor,
visualize, and analyze the efficiency of education with ease. An approach based on data
tracking and analysis helps to define if there’s the need to change the used studying programs
for making better decisions and achieving better academic results. In addition to academic
performance the co-curriculars and volunteer work performed by students must also be taken
into consideration to get a more comprehensive assessment of potential employability and
opportunities. All this added with interests displayed by students and their commitment to them
can give a better evaluation than standard methods.

### Objectives: <br />

* If we consider our new education policy, this project can help students in choosing
electives related to their field of interest. Eg. In the US education system, students need
to decide their major after completing 2 years of graduation. Here, our project can play a
big role in suggesting major related courses.<br/>

* It helps our CDGC(Carrier Development & Guidance Centre) for screening students for specific profiles.<br/>

* Also, students can target specific companies (which will be suggested by our app).<br/>

* Further, we can help students by suggesting the right career path for them.<br/>


### Working:<br />

i. To establish a baseline the student will be taking a self assessment test, which will lay
   the foundation of our suggestion algorithm. From this test we will get to know the
   student's initial field of interests.This could help in analysing his/her personality &
   cognitive skills. <br />

ii. Based on our first assessment some suggestions will be made, the success of these
suggestions is assessed and further recommendation is based on this. <br />

iii. The self assessment test can be taken multiple times and changes to preferences and
interests can be made any time. <br />

iv. The Skills used in co- curriculars and projects and initiatives are also taken into account
for making suggestions and increasing employability projection of students.<br />
